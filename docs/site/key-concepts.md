# Key Concepts

SPX is an acronym for **Single Page XHR** and derived from terminologies used to describe modern JavaScript paradigms like **SPA** (Single Page Application) and **MPA** (Multiple Page Application). The approach **SPX** employs is otherwise known as **Pjax** (Push state Ajax). Pjax is a rendering technique first introduced by the Github Co-Founder [Chris Wanstrath](http://github.com/defunkt). In 2011, Chris created [jquery-pjax](https://pjax.herokuapp.com/) which intercepted clicks made on link elements and fetched pages over the wire instead of executing full-page reloads between visits.

SPX introduces new techniques to this paradigm and combines them with strategies standardized by similar projects in the nexus like Turbo. The aim is instantaneous navigation, progressive enhancement and simple integration.
