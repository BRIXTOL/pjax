# spx-node

The `spx-node` attribute is a component specific attribute that can be used to define elements within the DOM that you will require access to within component classes. The directive accepts a special structure dot notated value of `component.name` wherein `component` represents the SPX component identifier value as per `spx-component="*"` and the `name` represents the value that SPX uses when defining scope.
