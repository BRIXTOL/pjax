# ğŸ§ª Nested Component Structures

Cases where components are nested within one another multiple times. In this case, each component is a child of the some component. We are using **alias** identifiers and only a single component is used in this case that has been mounted multiple times in the DOM. We are testing 2 capabilities here, the first being nested structures, the second being alias based targeting.
