# spx-target

This tests the `spx-target` directive. This block of text will be present during an SPX session when the starting page URL equals `directives/spx-target` and it will persist when navigating to **Page A**, **Page B** and **Page C**. If the SPX session does not begin at page pathname `directives/spx-target` then this text block will not be present as we are only targeting certain elements using the attribute.
