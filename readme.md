# @brixtol/pjax

Blazing fast, lightweight (9kb gzipped) and feature full new generation pjax solution. This pjax variation supports multiple fragment replacements, advanced pre-fetching capabilities and employs a snapshot caching engine to prevent subsequent requests from occurring.

### Features

- Simple and painless integration.
- Pre-fetching capabilities using hover, intersect and proximity triggers.
- Snapshot caching engine and per-page state control.
- Powerful target and document triggered lifecycle event dispatching.
- Provides a client side DOM hydration approach.
- Supports both append and prepend fragment replacements
- Dependency management system
- Couples perfectly with [stimulus.js](https://stimulusjs.org/).

### Demo

We are using this module live on our [webshop](https://brixtoltextiles.com).

### Why?

The landscape of pjax based solution has become rather scarce. The current bread winners either offer the same thing or for our use case were vastly over engineered. This pjax variation couples together various techniques found to be the most effective in enhancing the performance of SSR rendered web application which are fetching pages over the wire.

# Recommendations

In order to get the most of this module below are a few recommendations developers should consider when leveraging it within in their projects.

### Pre-fetching

The pre-fetching capabilities this Pjax variation provides can drastically improve the speed of rendering. When used correctly pages will load instantaneously between navigations. By default, the pre-fetching features are opt-in and require attribute annotation but you can customize how, when and where pjax should execute a pre-fetch.

### Stimulus

This module was originally developed as a replacement for [turbo](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo) so leveraging it together with [stimulus.js](https://stimulusjs.org/) is the preferred usage. Stimulus is a very simple framework and when working with SSR projects it helps alleviate the complications developers tend to face.

### Minification

By default, all fetched pages are stored in memory so for every request the HTML dom string response is saved to cache. The smaller your HTML pages the more performant the rendering engine will be. In addition to minification it is generally good practice to consider using semantic HTML5 as much as possible so as to negate the amount of markup pages require.

# Usage

To initialize, call `pjax.connect()` in your bundle preferably before anything else is loaded. By default, the entire `<body>` fragment is replaced upon each navigation. You should define a set of `targets[]` whose inner contents change on a per-page basis for optimal performance and consider leveraging the pre-fetching capabilities.

> The typings provided in this package will describe each option in good detail, below are the defaults and all options are optional.

```js
import * as pjax from '@brixtol/pjax';

pjax.connect({
  targets: ['body'],
  schema: 'pjax',
  timeout: 30000,
  poll: 15,
  async: true,
  cache: true,
  reverse: true,
  persist: false,
  limit: 50,
  preload: null,
  mouseover: {
    trigger: 'attribute',
    threshold: 250
  },
  intersect: {
    rootMargin: '',
    threshold: 0
  },
  proximity: {
    distance: 85,
    throttle: 500,
    threshold: 250
  },
  progress: {
    threshold: 850,
    minimum: 0.1,
    speed: 225,
    trickle: true,
    colour: '#111',
    height: '2px',
    easing: 'ease'
  }
});
```

# Options

### `targets`

Define page fragment targets which are expected to change on a per-page basis. By default, this pjax module will replace the entire `<body>` fragment. It's best to define specific fragments.

**Type:** `string[]` <br>
**Default:** `['body']` <br>

### `schema`

By default, attribute identifiers use a `-pjax-` identifier. You can use a custom attribute identifier.

**Type:** `string` <br>
**Default:** `pjax` <br>

### `timeout`

Request polling limit is used when a request is already in transit. Request completion is checked every 10ms, by default this is set to `30000` which means requests will wait `30s` before being a new request is triggered.

### `poll`

Request polling limit is used when a request is already in transit. Request completion is checked every 10ms, by default this is set to `1000` which means requests will wait `1s` before being a new request is triggered.

**Type:** `number` <br>
**Default:** `1000` <br>

### `async`

Determine if page requests should be fetched asynchronously or synchronously. Setting this to `false` is not recommended.

**Type:** `boolean` <br>
**Default:** `true` <br>

### `cache`

Enable or Disable caching. Each page visit request is cached and used in subsequent visits to the same location. Setting this to `false` is discourage as all visits will be fetched over the network and `data-pjax-cache` attribute configs will be ignored.

> If `cache` is disabled then prefetches will be dispatched using HTML5 `<link>` prefetches, else when cache is enabled it uses XHR.

**Type:** `boolean` <br>
**Default:** `true` <br>

### `persist`

The `persist` option can be used to restore cache into memory after a browser refresh has been triggered. When persisting cache a reference is maintained in session storage.

**Type:** `boolean` <br>
**Default:** `false` <br>

### `reverse`

Reverse caching. This will execute a pre-emptive fetch of the previous pages in the history stack when no snapshot exists in cache. Snapshots cache is purged when browser refresh occurs (unless `persist` is enabled) so when navigating backwards or pages will need to be re-fetched and this results in minor delays due to the refresh which was triggered.

**Type:** `boolean` <br>
**Default:** `true` <br>

### `limit`

Cache size limit. This pjax variation limits cache size to `50mb`and once it exceeds that limit, records will be removed starting from the earliest point of known cache entries.

**Type:** `number` <br>
**Default:** `50` <br>

### `mouseover`

Mouseover pre-fetching. You can disable mouseover (hover) pre-fetching by setting this to `false` which will prevent observers from executing and any `data-pjax-mouseover` attributes will be ignored. To use the default configurations you can set this to `true` or simply omit it.

**Type:** `boolean` or `object` <br>
**Default:** `{ trigger: 'attribute', threshold: 250 }` <br>

### `mouseover.trigger`

How mouseover prefetches should be triggered. By default this option is set to trigger only when `<a>` href link elements are attributed with a `data-pjax-mouseover` attribute. You can instruct pjax to execute pre-fetching on all `<a>` elements by setting this option to `href`. If you set the trigger to `href` you can annotate links you wish to exclude from prefetch with `data-pjax-mouseover="false"`.

**Type:** `string` <br>
**Accepts:** `attribute` or `href` <br>
**Default:** `attribute` <br>

### `mouseover.threshold`

Controls the fetch delay threshold. Requests will fire only when the mouse is both within range and the threshold time limit defined here has exceeded.

**Type:** `number` <br>
**Default:** `250` <br>

### `proximity`

Proximity pre-fetching allow for requests to be dispatched when the cursor is within a proximity range of a href link element. Coupling proximity with mouseover prefetches enable predicative fetching to occur, so a request will trigger before any interaction with a link element happens. To use default behavior, set this to `true` and all `<a>` annotated with a `data-pjax-proximity` attribute will be pre-fetched.

> Annotate any `<a>` links you wish to exclude from pre-fetching using the `data-pjax-proximity="false"`

**Type:** `boolean` or `object` <br>
**Default:** `{ distance: 75, throttle: 500, threshold: 250 }` <br>

### `proximity.distance`

The distance range the mouse should be within before the prefetch is triggered. You can optionally override this by assigning a number value to the proximity attribute. An href element using `data-pjax-proximity="50"` would inform Pjax to begin fetching when the mouse is within `50px` of the element.

**Type:** `number` <br>
**Default:** `75` <br>

### `proximity.throttle`

Controls the fetch delay threshold. Requests will fire only when the mouse is both within range and the threshold time limit defined here has exceeded.

**Type:** `number` <br>
**Default:** `500` <br>

### `proximity.threshold`

Controls the fetch delay threshold. Requests will fire only when the mouse has exceeded the range and the threshold time limit defined here has been exceeded.

**Type:** `number` <br>
**Default:** `250` <br>

### `intersect`

Intersection pre-fetching. Intersect pre-fetching leverages the [Intersection Observer](https://shorturl.at/drLW9) API to fire requests when elements become visible in viewport. You can disable intersect pre-fetching by setting this to `false`, otherwise you can customize the intersect fetching behavior. To use default behavior, set this to `true` and all elements annotated with with a `data-pjax-intersect` or `data-pjax-intersect="true"` attribute will be pre-fetched. You can annotate nodes containing href links or `<a>` directly.

> Annotate any `<a>` links you wish to exclude from intersection pre-fetching using the `data-pjax-intersect="false"`

**Type:** `boolean` or `object` <br>
**Default:** `{ rootMargin: '0px 0px 0px 0px', throttle: 0 }` <br>

### `intersect.rootMargin`

An offset rectangle applied to the root's href bounding box. The option is passed to the Intersection Observer.

**Type:** `string` <br>
**Default:** `0px 0px 0px 0px` <br>

### `proximity.throttle`

Threshold limit passed to the intersection observer instance.

**Type:** `number` <br>
**Default:** `500` <br>

### `proximity.threshold`

# Real World

Below is a real world example you can use to better understand how this module works and how it can be applied to your web application. We are working on providing a live demonstration for more advanced use cases but the below example should give you a good understanding of how to leverage this module.

<details>
<summary>
Example
</summary>

The first thing we want to do is make a connection with Pjax. In your JavaScript bundle we need to initialize it (connect). Our example web application has 3 pages, the **home** page, **about** page and **contact** page. We are going to instruct pjax to replace the `<nav>` and `<main>` fragments on every visit and then we are going to leverage `data-pjax` attributes to replace an additional fragment when we navigate to the contact page.

<br>
<strong>JavaScript Bundle</strong>
<br>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
import * as Pjax from "@brixtol/pjax";


Pjax.connect({ targets: ["nav", "main"] });


```

**Home Page**

<br>
Below we have a very basic Home Page with pjax wired up. All `<a>` elements will be intercepted and cached as per the default configuration. SSR web applications (in most cases) will only ever have a couple of fragments that change between navigation.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Home Page</title>
    <script src="/bundle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <header>

      <h1>@brixtol/pjax</h1>

      <!-- THIS FRAGMENT WILL BE REPLACED -->
      <nav>

        <!-- This link will be intercepted -->
        <a
         href="/home"
         class="active">Home</a>

        <!-- These links will be pe-fetched on hover -->
        <a
         href="/about"
         data-pjax-mouseover>About</a>

        <!-- This link will replace the #foo fragment -->
        <a
         href="/contact"
         data-pjax-replace="(['#foo'])">Contact</a>
      </nav>

    </header>

    <!-- THIS FRAGMENT WILL BE REPLACED -->
    <main>

      <h1>Welcome to the home page</h1>

      <div class="container">
        Brixtol Textiles is a Swedish apparel brand!
      </div>

    </main>

    <div id="foo">
      This fragment will not be touched until /contact is clicked
    </div>

    <footer>
      This fragment will not be touched during navigations as it's not
      defined within targets.
    </footer>

  </body>
</html>

```

**About Page**
<br>

The about page in our web application would look practically identical to the home page. We instructed pjax to pre-fetch this page upon hover by annotating the `<a>` href link with `data-pjax-mouseover` attribute. This attribute informs pjax to being fetching the page the moment the user hovers over the `<a>` link which results in the visit being instantaneous. The **about** page only has some minor differences, but for the sake of clarity, lets have look:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>About Page</title>
    <script src="/bundle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <header>

      <h1>@brixtol/pjax</h1>

      <!-- THIS FRAGMENT WILL BE REPLACED -->
      <nav>

        <!-- This link will be intercepted -->
        <a
         href="/home">Home</a>

        <!-- These links will be pe-fetched on hover -->
        <a
         href="/about"
         class="active"
         data-pjax-mouseover>About</a>

        <!-- This link will replace the #foo fragment -->
        <a
         href="/contact"
         data-pjax-replace="(['#foo'])">Contact</a>
      </nav>

    </header>

    <!-- THIS FRAGMENT WILL BE REPLACED -->
    <main>

      <h1>Welcome to the About Page</h1>

      <div class="container">
        Brixtol Textiles makes jackets out of recycled PET bottles.
        <p>Producing clothing in a sustainable way is the future!</p>
      </div>

    </main>

    <div id="foo">
      This fragment will not be touched until /contact is clicked
    </div>

    <footer>
      This fragment will not be touched during navigations as it's not
      defined within targets.
    </footer>

  </body>
</html>
```

**Contact Page**
<br>

The contact page will replace an additional fragment with the id value of `foo` which we informed upon via attribute annotation. Upon visiting this page the `<nav>`, `<main>` and `<div id="foo">` fragments will be replaced.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Contact Page</title>
    <script src="/bundle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <header>

      <h1>@brixtol/pjax</h1>

      <!-- THIS FRAGMENT WILL BE REPLACED -->
      <nav>

        <!-- This link will be intercepted -->
        <a
         href="/home">Home</a>

        <!-- These links will be pe-fetched on hover -->
        <a
         href="/about"
         class="active"
         data-pjax-mouseover>About</a>

        <!-- This link will replace the #foo fragment -->
        <a
         href="/contact"
         data-pjax-replace="(['#foo'])">Contact</a>
      </nav>

    </header>

    <!-- THIS FRAGMENT WILL BE REPLACED -->
    <main>

      <h1>Welcome to the Contact Page</h1>

      <div class="container">
        This is contact page of our example! The below fragment was replaced too!
      </div>

    </main>

    <!-- THIS FRAGMENT WAS REPLACE VIA ATTRIBUTE INSTRUCTION -->
    <div id="foo">
      This fragment was replaced!
    </div>

    <footer>
      This fragment will not be touched during navigations as it's not
      defined within targets.
    </footer>

  </body>
</html>
```

</details>

# Lifecycle Events

Lifecycle events are dispatched to the document upon each navigation. You can access contextual information from within the `event.detail` property. You can also cancel events with `preventDefault()` or by returning boolean `false` if you wish to prevent execution from occurring in a certain lifecycle.

The Pjax lifecycle events are dispatched in the following order of execution:

1. **pjax:prefetch**
2. **pjax:trigger**
3. **pjax:request**
4. **pjax:cache**
5. **pjax:render**
6. **pjax:hydrate**
7. **pjax:module**
8. **pjax:load**

> When a hydrate event is triggered the `pjax:hydrate` method will be fired instead of the `pjax:render`.

### Events

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```typescript
import type { Events } from '@brixtol/pjax'

// Triggered when a prefetch is triggered
document.addEventListener<Events.Prefetch>("pjax:prefetch", ({
  detail: {
    target: HTMLElement,
    route: IRoute,
    type: 'mouseover' | 'intersect' | 'proximity'
  }
}) => void | false)

// Triggered when a mousedown event occurs on a link
document.addEventListener<Events.Trigger>("pjax:trigger", ({
  detail: {
    target: HTMLElement,
    route: IRoute
  }
}) => void | false)

// Triggered before a page is fetched over XHR
document.addEventListener<Events.Request>("pjax:request", ({
  detail: {
    state: IPage,
    type: 'prefetch' | 'trigger'
  }
}) => void | false)

// Triggered before a page is cached
document.addEventListener<Events.Cache>("pjax:cache", ({
  detail: {
    state: IPage,
    type: 'prefetch' | 'trigger',
    snapshot: Document
  }
}) => void | false)

// Triggered before a page or fragment is rendered
document.addEventListener<Events.Render>("pjax:render", ({
  detail: {
    target: HTMLElement,
    newTarget: HTMLElement
  }
}) => void | false)

// Triggered before a fragment is hydrated
document.addEventListener<Events.Hydrate>("pjax:hydrate", ({
  detail: {
    target: HTMLElement,
    newTarget: HTMLElement
  }
}) => void | false)

// Triggered when a JavaScript module is loaded
document.addEventListener<Events.Module>("pjax:module", ({
  detail: {
    src: string,
    id: string,
    type: 'script' | 'style'
  }
}) => void | false)

// Triggered after a page has rendered
document.addEventListener<Events.Load>("pjax:load", ({
  detail: {
    state: IPage
  }
}) => void)
```

# Methods

In addition to Lifecycle events, you also have a list of methods available. Methods will allow you some basic programmatic control of the Pjax session occurring, provides access to the cache store and various other operational utilities.

```typescript
import * as pjax from '@brixtol/pjax'

// Check to see if Pjax is supported by the browser
pjax.supported: boolean

// Connects Pjax, called upon initialization
pjax.connect(options?): void

// Returns the current page state reference
pjax.current(): IPage

// Execute a programmatic pjax visit
pjax.visit(url?, options?): Promise<Page{}>

// Access the cache, pass in href for specific record
pjax.cache(url?): Page{}

// Returns a snapshot
pjax.snapshot(url?, options?): Document | { [id: string]: string }

// Clears the cache, pass in url to clear specific record
pjax.clear(url?): void

// Returns a UUID string via nanoid
pjax.uuid(size = 16): string

// Reloads the current page
pjax.reload(): Page{}

// Disconnects Pjax
pjax.disconnect(): void

```

# Attributes

Elements can be annotated with `data-pjax-*` attributes which you can leverage to customize how visits are rendered between navigations. By default, attributes are using a `-pjax-` schema but you can optionally provide a custom schema upon `connect` via the `schema` option.

- [data-pjax-eval](#data-pjax-eval)
- [data-pjax-disable](#data-pjax-disable)
- [data-pjax-hydrate](#data-pjax-hydrate)
- [data-pjax-replace](#data-pjax-replace)
- [data-pjax-prepend](#data-pjax-prepend)
- [data-pjax-append](#data-pjax-append)
- [data-pjax-mouseover](#data-pjax-mouseover)
- [data-pjax-threshold](#data-pjax-threshold)
- [data-pjax-proximity](#data-pjax-proximity)
- [data-pjax-position](#data-pjax-position)
- [data-pjax-cache](#data-pjax-cache)
- [data-pjax-history](#data-pjax-history)

## data-pjax-eval

Used on resources contained within the `<head>` fragment like styles, scripts or meta tags. Use this attribute if you want pjax to evaluate scripts and/or stylesheets. This option accepts a `false` value so you can define which scripts to execute on each navigation. By default, pjax will run and evaluate all `<script>` tags it detects for every page visit but will not re-evaluate `<script src="*"></script>` tags.

> When a `<script>` tag is detected on a pjax navigation and annotated with `data-pjax-eval="false"` then execution will be triggered only once upon but never again after that.

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Tags</strong>
</summary>

The `data-pjax-eval` attribute can be annotated on any of the below HTML tags:

- `<meta>`
- `<link>`
- `<style>`
- `<script>`

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Values</strong>
</summary>

This attribute is a `boolean` type. Passing the `true` value is optional as `data-pjax-eval` infers truthy.

- `true`
- `false`

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Example</strong>
</summary>

```html
<script>
  console.log('I will run on every navigation');
</script>

<!-- script will only run once when between pjax visits -->
<script data-pjax-eval="false">
  console.log('I will run on initialization only!');
</script>
```

</details>

## data-pjax-disable

Use on `<a>` elements to disable pjax navigation. When a link element is annotated with `data-pjax-disable` a normal page navigation will be executed and cache will be cleared. You can optionally restore the cache using the `data-pjax-cache="restore"` attribute when navigating back to a pjax enabled url.

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Tags</strong>
</summary>

The `data-pjax-disable` attribute can be used on the following tags:

- `<a>`

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Values</strong>
</summary>

This attribute is a `truthy` type. Passing the `true` value is optional as `data-pjax-disable` infers truthy.

- `true`

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Examples</strong>
</summary>

Clicking this link will clear cache and a normal page navigation will be executed.

```html
<a href="*" data-pjax-disable></a>
```

Clicking this link will execute a normal page navigation but will inform pjax to save the current cache and restore it upon the next pjax enabled visit. See [data-pjax-cache](#data-pjax-cache) for more information.

```html
<a href="*" data-pjax-cache="restore" data-pjax-disable></a>
```

</details>

## data-pjax-track

Place on elements to track on a per-page basis that might otherwise not be contained within target elements. This methods will append nodes to the document `<body>` and placement is not certain. This is helpful when you need to reference an `svg` sprite of template or some sort.

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Tags</strong>
</summary>

The `data-pjax-track` attribute can be annotated on any HTML contained within `<body>` but cannot be applied to `<a>` href links.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Values</strong>
</summary>

This attribute is a `truthy` type. Passing the `true` value is optional as `data-pjax-track` infers truthy.

- `true`

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Example</strong>
</summary>

Lets assume you are navigating from `Page 1` to `Page 2` and `#main` is your defined target. When you navigate from `Page 1` only the `#main` target will be replaced and any other dom elements will be skipped that are not contained within the `#main` HTML tag. When annotating `data-pjax-track` to elements located outside of target/s which will be added and persisted on all future navigations.

**Page 1**

```html
<nav>
  <a href="/page-1" class="active">Page 1</a>
  <a href="/page-2">Page 2</a>
</nav>

<div id="#main">
  <div class="block">I will be replaced, I am active on every page.</div>
</div>
```

**Page 2**

```html
<nav>
  <a href="/page-1">Page 1</a>
  <a href="/page-2" class="active">Page 2</a>
</nav>

<div id="#main">
  <div class="block">I will be replaced, I am active on every page.</div>
</div>

<!-- This element will be appended to the dom -->
<div data-pjax-track>
  I am outside of target and will be tracked if pjax was initialized on Page 1
</div>

<!-- This element will not be appended to the dom -->
<div>I will not be tracked unless Pjax was initialized on Page 2</div>
```

> If navigation started on `Page 2` then Pjax will have knowledge of the tracked elements existence before navigating away. In such a situation the tracked element is marked internally and the handling will be identical.

</details>

## data-pjax-hydrate

Executes a controlled replacement of the defined elements. You should perform hydration when server side logic is required to adjust or apply changes to a visitors session as it will allow your application to seamlessly adapt and progressively align the UI without having to trigger a full-page reload. Hydration incurs side effects and the pjax session will be augmented, see below:

1. Only current and previous page cache is aligned (updated), all other existing records are purged.
2. You cannot restore purged cache. Any `data-pjax-cache="restore"` methods will be ignored.
3. Hydration is skipped when target location pathname does not match trigger location pathname.
4. History stack will not be touched, the visit is executed in the background.

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Tags</strong>
</summary>

The `data-pjax-hydrate` attribute can be used on the following tags:

- `<a>`
- `<button>`
- `<form>`
- `<input>`

> Triggering via an annotated `<button>` element will execute hydration on current url.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Values</strong>
</summary>

Lets assume we informed pjax to trigger replacements on the `#menu`, `#main` and `#note` between navigations upon connection, for example:

```js
pjax.connect({ targets: ['#menu', '#main', '#note'] });
```

When performing a navigation visit the target elements `#menu`, `#main` and `#note` would be replaced (as expected) but when a trigger tag element is using a `data-pjax-hydrate` attribute then pjax will only preform replacements on the elements defined within the `data-pjax-hydrate` annotation, for example:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html

<!-- This node will not be replaced during hydration visit only on navigation visit -->
<nav id="menu">

  <!-- Pressing this link will trigger a navigation visit  -->
  <a
   href="/home">Replaces the #menu, #main and #note elements</a>

  <!-- Pressing this link triggers hydration and replaces all .price nodes -->
  <a
   href="/products?currency=SEK"
   data-pjax-hydrate="(['.price'])">Perform server side action</a>

</nav>

<!-- This node will not be replaced during hydration visit only on navigation visit -->
<section id="note">
  The next navigation will replace all elements using class "price"
  and "cart-count" - If you have defined the element "#main" as a "target"
  in your connection, a replacement will not be made on that element,
  instead only the elements defined in "data-pjax-hydrate" are replaced.
</section>


<!-- This node will be replaced on hydration -->
<span class="cart-count">1</span>

<!-- This node will be replaced on hydration -->
<span class="price">€ 450</span>

<div id="main">
  <img src="*">
  <ul>
    <li>Great Product</li>
    <!-- This node will be replaced on hydration -->
    <li class="price">€ 100</li>
    <li>Awesome Product</li>
    <!-- This node will be replaced on hydration -->
    <li class="price">€ 200</li>
    <li>Cool Product</li>
    <!-- This node will be replaced on hydration -->
    <li class="price">€ 300</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- Pressing this triggers hydration and replaces the .cart-count node -->
<button data-pjax-hydrate="(['.cart-count'])">

## data-pjax-mouseover

Performs a prefetch of the `href` url upon mouseover (hover). By default, mouseover pre-fetching is enabled but expects attribute annotation on links. You can have pjax execute pre-fetching on all `<a>` links by setting `trigger` to `href` in `pjax.connect()`. If you have set `trigger` to `href`then you you do not need to define the attribute on links, unless you wish to skip executing the pre-fetch, eg: `<a data-pjax-mouseover="false">`. If you set mouseover pre-fetching to `false` in your `pjax.connect()` settings then annotations will be ignored and mouseover pre-fetching will be disabled.

> On mobile devices the `mouseover` value will execute on the `touchstart` event

<details>
<summary>

<a href="*" data-pjax-mouseover="false"></a>
```

</details>

## data-pjax-threshold

By default, this will be set to `100` or whatever preset configuration was defined in `pjax.connect()` but you can override those settings by annotating the link with this attribute. The `data-pjax-threshold` attribute should be used together attributes that accept threshold control.

</details>

## data-pjax-cache

Controls the caching engine of each pjax navigation. When using `data-pjax-cache` together with prefetch attributes like `data-pjax-mouseover` the action is respected.

### false

Passing a `false` value will execute a pjax visit that will not be saved to cache and if the link exists in cache it will be removed.

### reset

Passing a `reset` value will remove the cache reference existing at the location of the trigger. A new pjax visit will be executed and the response will saved to cache, replacing the previous record.

### clear

Passing a `clear` value will purge the entire cache store and all records will be removed.

### restore

Passing a `restore` value will save the current cache to session storage which allows the store to be maintained during page a refresh. The cache will exist in session storage and be restored to memory when another pjax visit is triggered. The restore method can be used together with `data-pjax-disable` or when navigating to an external webpage. If the tab or browser is closed then session storage is purged.

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Tags</strong>
</summary>

The `data-pjax-cache` attribute can be used on the following tags:

# State

Each page visited has a state value. Page state is immutable and created for every unique url `/path` or `/pathname?query=param` location that has been encountered throughout the pjax session. The state value of each page is added to its pertaining History stack record and it will be referenced on subsequent visits. This approach drastically improves TTFB and provides a specific store for every page.

> Navigation sessions begin once a Pjax connection has been established and ends when a browser refresh is executed or url origin changes. You can maintain and restore sessions using cache methods.

## Read

You can access page state via the `event.details.state` property provided in certain dispatched lifecycle events or via the `pjax.cache()` method. The caching engine used by this Pjax variation acts as mediator when a session begins, when you access page state via the `pjax.cache()` method you are given a bridge to the object that holds all active sessions of the cache store kept in browser memory.

## Write

State modifications can be carried out using attributes, method or from within dispatched events. When using the `Pjax.visit()` method you can apply state modification to the `options` parameter and changes will be merged before a visit begins. You should avoid modifying state outside of the available methods, treat state as **read only** and architect your application to prevent direct augmentation.

# How it works?

This pjax variation is leveraging modern browser capabilities. What makes this pjax variant faster than others is how the pages are fetched and the caching approach it employs.

### Fetching

Pages are fetches using XHR opposed to the Fetch API. Because we are dealing with HTML there is no benefit of using Fetch over XHR. The main

### Rendering

1. An XHR request can begin on mousedown, mouseover, element intersection or via cursor proximity.
2. The response DOM string of fetched pages is stored in memory, so page requests are only ever executed once.
3. Stored pages (snapshots) are re-used when returning visits to cached (stored) locations occur.
4. The DOM Parser API is used in the rendering cycle, only specific elements (targets) are replaced.
5. The state model of the History API is used maintain page specific configuration references.
6.

# Contributing

This module is written in TypeScript. Production bundles exports to ES2015. This project has been open sourced from within a predominantly closed source mono/multi repo. We will update it according to what we need. Feel free to suggest features or report bugs and PR's are welcome!

### Development

The projects is functional, there are no classes, just functions. Application state considered as global is exported from [app/state.ts](https://github.com/BRIXTOL/pjax/blob/master/src/app/store.ts) and the rendering apparatus is contained within [app/render.ts](https://github.com/BRIXTOL/pjax/blob/master/src/app/render.ts). The [observers](https://github.com/BRIXTOL/pjax/blob/master/src/observers) directory contains the various fetch and pre-fetch logics. Objects avoid the prototype and `Object.create(null)` is the preferred approach.

The project is fairly each to understand, there are no complexities and over-engineering. The Pjax method is simple, you fetch pages over the wire and replace elements in the rendering cycle.
